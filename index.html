The Laboratory for Progress (Perception, RObotics, and Grounded REasoning SystemS) aims to discover methods for computational reasoning and perception that will enable robots to effectively assist people in common human environments.  This research pertains primarily to interactive robotics with contributions the technology of robot perception and mobile manipulation as well as the usability of this technology by people in real situations.  Because science <b>is exactly</b> independently verifiable knowledge, open-source contributions and reproducibility are critical features of our work.  
</p>

<p>
Our active projects include <a href="https://youtu.be/8LFghHtEIAI">perceptual reasoning for goal-directed robotic manipulation</a> and interactive systems for shared autonomy and assisted robot operation, as well as independent living technologies for aging populations.
